<div class="subjectBox">FAQ:</div>




<div class="subjectBox" style="font-size: 1.8em;">How do I contact the administrator?</div>

<div class="titleBox">If you wish to contact the administrator about an issue concerning the account you own or the website itself, please contact us at +1 (614) 596-7346 or email us at email@email.com. Feedback about the site is appreciated as well. </div>



<div class="subjectBox" style="font-size: 1.8em;">How do I edit my account credentials?</div>

<div class="titleBox">To edit your account information, first return to home. There you will find three main tabs. Scroll toward the second tab labeled 'Other Stuff' and click on the link labeled 'Account'. In Account, you will find two other links labled 'Edit Account' and 'Delete Account'. Click Edit Account. In Edit Account, you will then find 'Edit Name' and 'Edit Username'. Follow the instructions within each to complete the processes.</div>


<div class="subjectBox" style="font-size: 1.8em;">What does ID mean?</div>

<div class="titleBox">When patients are registered, they are each given a special number called an ID. This is so their information does not get collided with another patient who may own the same name, age, or birth date. To find the ID, either scroll down to 'All Patients' or search for the patient in the search bar. You will find a hashtag followed by a number above the rest of the information. This is that patient's ID.</div>


<div class="subjectBox" style="font-size: 1.8em;">How do I retrieve my password?</div>

<div class="titleBox">Unfortunately, we have not devised a way to retrieve or edit password. If you have forgotten your account credentials or lost access to your account in any way, contact the administrator so that we can proceed to erase your account. In the meantime, it would be advised to create a new account. We apologize for this inconvience.</div>
